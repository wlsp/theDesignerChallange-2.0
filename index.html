        <h2>Every idea &#128161; starts with a need</h2>
        <p>
          Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I
          could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted
          to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on
          paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some
          challenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought. I
          saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user
          interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the
          result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.

        After several weeks of sticking to this challenge, I learned a lot

          <strong>Start with asking why</strong><br />
          You will start seeing things differently and coming up with more
          effective ways of achieving goals.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Your ideas will have more value</strong><br />
          By looking at problems from a different perspective, your ideas will
          be fresher and more valuable.

          <strong>Design solutions with love</strong><br />
          Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand the
          frustration of the users and resolve to end it.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/img/title03.svg" alt="" class="iconAside" /><br />
        <p>
          <strong>Share and show your work</strong><br />
          As designers, we are often afraid of showing work thatâ€™s not
          finished or doesnâ€™t look perfect. You will learn to accept feedback
          and learn from it.

        <p>
          The challenge lasts 30 days. On each of those days you will have to
          create asolution to any problem you yourself are facing and show the
          result to the community.

          <strong>Find your Problem</strong><br />
          It has to be a problem thatâ€™s personally affecting or affected you,
          like finding your keys, calling a taxi or even remembering
          something. Open your eyes, look around you carefully and pay close
          attention to your surroundings.

          <strong>Think about the solution</strong><br />
          It's time to look for solutions. What can you do to solve these
          problems? It's time to think out of the box, grab your notebook and
          start writing down all the ideas that come to mind.

          <strong>Design your proposal</strong><br />
          How can design help solve your problem? It's time to think about
          features and functionality, and then start designing. Donâ€™t forget
          to always ask yourself: Would I actually use this?
